## About Me

I’m William, a Ph.D. student at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu)
a part of [ChiData](https://data.cs.uchicago.edu), 
where I am advised by [Aaron Elmore](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~aelmore/). 
I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and completed my B.A. at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu)
where I was a part of the [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu) and worked a variety of amazing projects, such as [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and [Modin](https://github.com/modin-project/modin)!
